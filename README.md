# stopwatch
A simple GUI stopwatch using Tkinter in Python.
The program works with Python 3 as well as Python 2. It should work on any OS on which Tkinter works. A windows executable is also included which is a single file without any dependancies.

###Important
It is not accurate, neither is it meant to be. I just made it to use Tkinter and learn making standalone executable using pyinstaller.
